Some examples of declarative customizations in Salesforce are 
flows, validation rules, processes, workflows, or UI elements
such as reports and dashboards or page layouts. Using these 
declarative features we can provide automation, or UI without
the use of any hard coding and can all be done with a point 
and click. Programatic on the other hand would be a something
like a trigger, visualforce, or LWC's. Programatic customizations 
use Apex and another languages and frameworks to provide an even 
more complex customized app.
